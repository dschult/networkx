Code of Conduct
===============


Introduction
------------

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the NetworkX project,
including all public and private mailing lists, issue trackers, wikis, and
any other communication channel used by our community.

This code of conduct should be honored by everyone who participates in
the NetworkX community formally or informally, or claims any affiliation with the
project, in any project-related activities and especially when representing the
project, in any role.

This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common
understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. Please try to
follow this code in spirit as much as in letter, to create a friendly and
productive environment that enriches the surrounding community.

We have adopted the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct to allow people with some separation
and some training to further the Code of Conduct goals.

NetworkX uses the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct
------------------------------------------

You can find the whole document at
`the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct website <https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct>`_

The Short Version
-----------------

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down others. Behave professionally.
Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not
appropriate for NumFOCUS. NetworkX uses the NumfOCUS Code of Conduct and this
short version is language provided by their Code of Conduct Working Group.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including
people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not
appropriate.

NumFOCUS is dedicated to providing a harassment-free community for everyone,
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not
tolerate harassment of community members in any form.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for all.

Long Version
------------

You can find the long version of the Code of Conduct on
`the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct website <https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct>`_

How To Report
-------------

If you notice any behavior, incident, or situation that seems inappropriate
or violates our Code of Conduct, we encourage you to report it via the
`NumFOCUS Code of Conduct Reporting Form
<https://numfocus.typeform.com/to/ynjGdT?typeform-source=numfocus.org>`_ .
That report can be submitted anonymously if that feels more comfortable for you.

Please note that the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct is not an exhaustive document
and continues to evolve. Even if the incident you wish to report is not
explicitly mentioned in the Code of Conduct, we still encourage you to report it.

Who Will Receive Your Report
----------------------------

Your report will be received and handled by NumFOCUS Code of Conduct Working
Group; trained, and experienced contributors with diverse backgrounds. The
group is making decisions independently from the project, PyData, NumFOCUS or
any other organization.
The CoC Working Group will investigate and make recommendations to the
NetworkX Community about appropriate responses. The NetworkX Community
has the final decision about actions taken.

You can learn more about the reporting procedure as well as the current group
members at
`the NumFOCUS Code of Conduct website <https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct>`_
(e.g. search that page for "current list of voting members")

What Happens Next
-----------------

The CoC Working Group will investigate each report and make recommendations to the
NetworkX Community about appropriate responses. The NetworkX Community, through
the NetworkX Steering Council, makes final decisions about actions taken.
Enforcement is enacted via transparent decision by the NetworkX Steering Council.

In case of severe and obvious breaches, e.g., personal threat or violent, sexist
or racist language, we will immediately disconnect the originator from NetworkX
communication channels.

Diversity Statement
-------------------

NumFOCUS and NetworkX are dedicated to providing a harassment-free community
for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and
expression, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.
We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form.

The NetworkX project welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. We are
committed to being a community that everyone enjoys being part of. Although
we may not always be able to accommodate each individual's preferences, we try
our best to treat everyone kindly.

No matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you.
Though no list can hope to be comprehensive, we explicitly honour diversity in:
age, culture, ethnicity, genotype, gender identity or expression, language,
national origin, neurotype, phenotype, political beliefs, profession, race,
religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, subculture and technical
ability.

Though we welcome people fluent in all languages, NetworkX development is
conducted in English.

Standards for behaviour in the NetworkX community are detailed in the Code of
Conduct above. Participants in our community should uphold these standards
in all their interactions and help others to do so as well (see next section).
